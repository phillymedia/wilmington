<p>Yet, Wilmington is the product of a remarkable point in its history.</p>

{% set ad = ["21"] %} {% include "partials/ad.html" %}

<p>Fifty years ago, in&nbsp;<a href="http://wilmington1968.org/">1968</a>, thousands of National Guardsmen were hailed to Wilmington by the state's then-Governor&nbsp;in response to&nbsp;a civil uprising that came in the wake of Martin Luther King Jr.'s April assassination.</p>

            {% set quote = ["This is a quote here", "Source of quote"] %} {% include "partials/left-quote.html" %}

            <p>For nearly a year, armed guards patrolled the west center city, a mostly black community known as "The Valley," making history as the longest occupation of an American city since King's death.</p>
            <p>Many long-time Wilmington residents describe the nine-month-long occupation as an event that would transform them, and Wilmington for decades to come. It was a moment that displayed&nbsp;the effect of a heavy-handed government response and what that meant for residents who lived through it.</p>
            <p><img class="alignnone size-horizontal-hi-res wp-image-801342" src="https://dixon.philly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/1383307_219cc4ec274966a-1200x800.jpg" alt="" data-image-id="801342" data-image-caption="" data-image-credit="Temple University" data-image-source="1816/1299671" width="1200" height="800"></p>
            <p>In that time, normalcy was redefined for Wilmington's black residents.</p>
            <p>Day in and day out, locals watched jeeps creep by carrying mostly white soldiers in battle helmets who held rifles with bayonets strapped to their sides.&nbsp;Those who worked and went to school adjusted their schedules to be home by the state mandated curfew. Many white shoppers, commuters, and workers were fearful to visit Wilmington.</p>
            <p>After King was assassinated,&nbsp;many African Americans were swept up in a swell of emotions from grief to frustration. In the days after, riots broke out in more than 100 cities nationwide.</p>
            <p>Wilmington was the only city of those that rioted that was occupied by The National Guard for almost a year.&nbsp;<strong>The guard was finally pulled out of&nbsp;the city hours after Former Gov. Russell Peterson took the oath of office on Jan. 21, 1969.</strong></p>
            <p>That moment in Wilmington's history is etched in the minds of those who lived through what some called riots, but what others called an uprising. <strong>[vignette blocks]</strong></p>
            <p>Fifty years later, the west center city community, and city at-large has never fully recovered.</p>
            <p>Crime pervades&nbsp;the town with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/wilmingtoncitydelaware">just over 71,000 residents</a>, where youth&nbsp;are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2017/09/08/our-babies-killing-each-other/100135370/">more likely to be shot</a> than any other American city, 2017 reports said. Violence was so bad in recent years that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href="https://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/cdcfinalreport.pdf">came up with a plan for Wilmington</a> to treat gun violence as a public health epidemic.</p>
            <p>Once a manufacturing city and hub for corporations and mom-and-pop shops alike, today Wilmington struggles to shake its violent reputation, despite shootings being down from recent years.&nbsp;A slew of gun&nbsp;violence and relatively high murder rates&nbsp;<a href="https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/crime/2017/09/08/delawares-economy-suffers-wilmingtons-violence/102562232/">have impacted Delaware's economy</a>, reports said.</p>
            <p>Many of the issues that were protested in 1968 are still protested today -- fair and just housing, equal education, an end to police intimidation, job opportunities, opportunities for class mobility and more.</p>
            <p>In recent years, there have been efforts to turn west center city around, including current Wilmington Mayor Mike Purzycki deeming it the pilot location for the <a href="https://www.wilmingtonde.gov/Home/Components/News/News/462/">city's neighborhood stabilization program</a>.</p>
            <p>Still, many point to 1968 as the source of turmoil and long-time decline.</p>




            <p>"The city hasn't completely healed," said Angela Winand, who leads the Mitchell Center for African American Heritage at the Delaware Historical Society.</p>
            <p>"This is something that people lived through and remember. The young people that marched on the street are still alive. Their younger siblings are still alive and here and trying to make Wilmington better," Winand said.</p>
            <p>On April 8, 1968, Clint Perkins made strides&nbsp;with his fist raised&nbsp;down the middle of Market Street, a bustling hub of retail shops and theaters considered the heart of Wilmington, alongside hoards of young, black high school students, mostly men.</p>
            <p>Perkins was at the forefront of the group headed to&nbsp;Rodney Square, another city hub, for a memorial in King's honor. The portrait was one&nbsp;of the few that captured the peaceful march that occurred moments before [riots] broke out. It later became one of the most recognizable and widely-circulated portraits of the event.</p>





            <p>And though its been 50 years - Perkins, now 70, was two months away from graduation at Howard High School then -- the occupation, and its lasting effect, still sticks out clearly in his mind.</p>
            <p>"I just knew that we had a long ways to go before we were equal, which made me get involved with civil rights and just pay a little more attention to [black] people, what we were going through," Perkins said.</p>
            <p>Hours after their peaceful protest began, the scene on Market Street was chaos, with Perkins in the midst of it all.</p>
            <p>Shattered glass littered the streets and thick, black smoke was heavy in the air, gun shots blasted through the air sporadically. Stores and homes were engulfed in flames. Streets were strewn with mounds of garbage and debris from looting. People ran, screaming all the way.</p>
            <p>Media reports at the time said by midnight on April 9, more than 50 people were arrested, at least a dozen were injured, 13 fires were report and 19 businesses were looted.</p>
            <p>[image_comparison left="740310" right="740312" position="center" /]</p>
            <p>The next day, April 9, in an attempt to restore what he called "law and order," then-Incumbent Democratic Governor Charles Terry activated the entire 3800-man Army and Air National Guard for deployment throughout the state. <strong>National guardsmen held a presence in the city until Jan. 21, 1969, when they were removed hours after newly-elected Gov. Russell Peterson took the oath of office.</strong></p>
            <p><a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20151222_Did_1968_occupation_of_Wilmington_spark_decline_.html">RELATED &gt;&gt;&gt; Did 1968 occupation of Wilmington spark decline?</a></p>
            <p>Soon after the occupation began, a stack of loosely bound pages titled Black Survival Guide or How to Survive a Police Riot were disseminated by a local civic association through the community.</p>
            <p>Pages of that guide appeared earlier this year at a Delaware Art Museum exhibition with the same name, as one of the many <a href="http://www.wilmington1968.org/">efforts to chronicle that event</a>.</p>
            <p>"Because you are Black, this booklet is important to you," the introduction reads. "It may help save your life."</p>






            <p>How to put out or escape a blaze, what foods to stock when stores close, and a list of emergency actions with instructions were all among the pages, meant to prepare black residents for what it called "the police riot," and what would come after.</p>
            <p>At the time, Wilmington had various coalitions and organizations, some of which were interracial, Winand said, that worked to solve the city's problems, including the Wilmington Youth Emergency Action Council and the NAACP.</p>
            <p>As a small child, Jea Street played in the corner of the room while his mom and other NAACP members meticulously planned, and debated about whether to boycott, sit-in or march to further the civil rights movement.</p>
            <p>When the occupation came, it wasn't a shock that Street wanted to be in the NAACP meetings, to see to it that the national guard came off the street and that Terry was removed from office.</p>





            <p>"The assassination and the occupation changed my life forever," Street said.</p>
            <p>Street was among Perkins and others when he marched from Wilmington High School, and witnessed when "all hell broke loose."</p>
            <p>But the gravity of the situation didn't sink in "until the following days where everywhere you look, there's the national guard," he said.</p>
            <p>"And from that point forward, I had great disdain for their presence," Street said. "They simply were not nice people."</p>
            <p>After the riots, Street said he saw high school hallways filled with blood from white teachers and youth being beat up, then hearing county police storm in, in riot gear, "that never goes away," he said.<strong>???</strong></p>
            <p>"And some of those victims never recovered. And you see them 50 years later and they still talk about it," Street said.</p>
            <p>From that point on, Street <a href="https://www.nccde.org/524/Jea-Street---District-10">would live a life dedicated to public service</a> in Wilmington. Now 65, Street has been a city councilman for nearly 15 years, and has been a member of a multitude of local civic groups, councils, coalitions, commissions, task forces and committees.</p>
            <p>He credits the occupation for opening his eyes to how far the city has left to go for true equality.</p>
            <p>"Even in my career today, it goes back to those NAACP meetings as a child," Street said.</p>
            <p>"Unfortunately, 50 years later, that fairness still does not exist. Even though we've continued to fight and continue to struggle," Street said.</p>
            <p>For historians, the summer of 1967 foreshadowed the forthcoming occupation.</p>
            <p>Terry was under the impression that trouble was bound to happen in Wilmington, so the state&nbsp;ordered a commission to examine whether a riot was imminent, said Simone Austin, a 2017 fellow with the Delaware Art Museum who penned <a href="https://www.delart.org/store/wilmington-1968-sourcebook/">the Wilmington 1968 sourcebook</a>.</p>
            <p>After the commission looked into housing, welfare, employment,and education, the consensus was "basically ... Wilmington is ripe" for a riot, Austin said.</p>
            <p>From there, Terry led&nbsp;a charge for tougher legislation and "strong law and order in the state," touting that the government needed to prevent what happened in other cities nationwide from happening in their backyard.</p>
            <p>A&nbsp;flurry of legislation was enacted, Austin said,&nbsp;"very strict" laws that addressed rioting, looting and explosive devices, like Moltov cocktails.</p>

                            {% include "partials/subscribebox.html" %}

            <p>Among the very strict anti-riot laws was that a 16-year-old could be charged as an adult if caught participating in a riot, which by definition meant more than one person gathering in a street causing a disturbance or threat to either property or people, Austin said.</p>
            <p>Many of those laws are <a href="http://delcode.delaware.gov/sessionlaws/ga124/chp118.shtml">still on the books</a>, she said.</p>

            {% set ad = ["22"] %} {% include "partials/ad.html" %}

            <p>"The largest&nbsp;[law] is that the governor can declare a state of emergency at any time, in which he alone has the only say in determining when that State of Emergency ends and that he can oversee the national guard,"&nbsp;Austin said. <a href="http://delcode.delaware.gov/title20/c031/sc03/index.shtml">That law is still on the books, too.</a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>So, while 50 years seems like a long time,&nbsp;"The issues of 1968 still persist," Winand said.</p>
